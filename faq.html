					  <h3>What does ModIT stand for?</h3>
					  <p>Modern Innovative Technology.</p>
					  <br/>
					  <h3>What are We?</h3>
					  <p>We are a club hosted at Townsend Harris High School, created during the 2016-17 school year.</p>
					  <br/>
					  <h3>What do we do?</h3>
					  <p>
						ModIT is focused on providing students with the tools, knowledge, and funding in order to bring their ideas to life. If you have an idea for a product, we will teach
						you the skills you need to create, market, and sell it.
					  </p>
					  <h3>When?</h3>
					  <p>
						Mondays and Wednsdays after school, until 4:30.
					  </p>
					  <h3>Why?</h3>
					  <p>
						ModIT was formed as an outlet for the creative and oppressed passions of several Townsend Harris students, who were dissatisfied with the way that certain other clubs are run.
					  </p>
					  
					  <br/>
					  <h3>How does the process work?</h3>
					  <p>
						First, students are taught lessons by the board of directors. These lessons involve the inner workings of the club, and help the students come up with ideas.
						They will then create a proposal for a product or idea, and receive lessons based on the knowledge necessary to bring it to fruition. These lessons include, but are not 
						limited to, topics such as mechanical, electrical and software engineering, finance, and art. Next, students will be able to apply for funding, and create a proposal that 
						goes to the board. If approved, ModIT is willing to donate to allow you to build up your company.
					  </p>
					  <br/>
					  <h3>Board of Directors? What's That?</h3>
					  <p>The government of ModIT is divided into three sections: The Executive Board, The Board of Directors, and General Members. The Executive Board runs the club, and manages the
						club's finances. All major decisions go through the Executive Board. The Board of Directors operates below the Executive Board, and is involved in managing the members,
						teaching lessons, interacting with members and measuring their performance and growth, and representing members within the ModIT government.
					  </p>
					  <br/>
					  <h3>Can I give you money?</h3>
					  <p>
						ModIT is (at least, will be) a nonprofit organization operating at Townsend Harris High School. We do not accept investments, however donations are accepted. See the <a href="/donate">donations page</a> for information on how to donate, or the <a href="/sponsors">sponsors page</a> for to become a sponsor.
