							<p style="text-align=center">ModIT was started in 2016 by a group of students at Townsend Harris High School in Queens, NY. Since then, the focus of the club has evolved into three main areas: coding, CAD, and data analysis. At ModIT, we strive to make knowledge of each of these concepts accessible to all students. In a field that uses innumerable downloads and abstruse concepts, simplicity is our priority. That is why we have created the Resources page on our website! We want to inspire students - whether or not they attend our meetings - to explore technology and engineering on their own time. Our goal is to show the Townsend Harris community that learning a new skill is only as difficult as you let it become. Join us in our mission to learn, create, and empower. Modern Innovative Technology. Nothing less.</p>
