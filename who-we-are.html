						<p class="newthing3 widtham">Hey! I'm William Olsen, or Billy if you prefer, and I'm gonna be Vice President of ModIT for the 2021-2022 school year.
I have an ambitious vision for ModIT as a club, and I hope that, in addition to helping our members learn in our various divisions, we can work on projects that bring the skills of these divisions together into an extraordinary product.
I've been a part of ModIT since my freshman year, seeing the strategies that best allowed the club to learn effectively and work productively.
I sincerely hope that all of our members get what they want out of ModIT, from knowledge in Programming or experience in Computer-Assisted Design.
Lookin' forward to working with you all! Feel free to reach out with questions.

							Hi!! I'm Christelle Diab, and I'm looking forward to being your social media manager for the 2021-2022 school year!! I plan on creating effective remainders and posts on our Instagram to help grow our follower base and remind students of upcoming meetings. One of my priorities will be showcasing the many different projects created in the various divisions of ModIT. Achieving that will allow me to display the hard work of both our directors and club members, reminding others that they don't need any prior experience to join! Another significant priority of mine will be engaging with our followers to help guarantee the best experience. As an incoming sophomore, I will also join the others in learning CAD as I believe that it's one of the most engaging divisions! I can't wait to meet everyone, and if you ever feel like you need to talk or have any questions, you can always reach out to me! :))

							anything you can quantify. Last year and this year I've been on the Robotics team, where I was a member of the CAD subteam.(I'm very proud of making a dual Falcon motor gearbox there. Feel free to ask me about it.) This summer I took a Cooper Union Drafting 
							and Design for Engineering class where I learned about how finance, business, and engineering all meld together in industries. This year we're aiming for an end-of-year project we can all look forward to. 
							My main goal this year is to make ModIT a club where you can enjoy learning about the tech of the future! Feel free to reach out to me or anyone on the board if you have questions, ideas, or just want to talk! I look forward to seeing y'all! :3

							I'm also in charge of sharing the joy of coding with you. I ended up becoming interested in

							section. I soon fell in love with coding, and began with learning Java. I hope to also inspire you 
							to love coding as I do and become interested in pursuing it later on. 
							I wish to work together with you all and learn together as one so that everyone feels welcome. 
							If you have any questions or anything you want to talk to us about, feel free to reach out
