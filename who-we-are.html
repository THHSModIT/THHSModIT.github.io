							anything you can quantify. Last year and this year I've been on the Robotics team, where I was a member of the CAD subteam.(I'm very proud of making a dual Falcon motor gearbox there. Feel free to ask me about it.) This summer I took a Cooper Union Drafting 
							and Design for Engineering class where I learned about how finance, business, and engineering all meld together in industries. This year we're aiming for an end-of-year project we can all look forward to. 
							My main goal this year is to make ModIT a club where you can enjoy learning about the tech of the future! Feel free to reach out to me or anyone on the board if you have questions, ideas, or just want to talk! I look forward to seeing y'all! :3

							Hello! I'm Amanda and I'm the vice president of the club. 
							I'm also in charge of sharing the joy of coding with you. I ended up becoming interested in 
							coding when I joined the school's robotics team and learned about their software engineering
							section. I soon fell in love with coding, and began with learning Java. I hope to also inspire you 
							to love coding as I do and become interested in pursuing it later on. 
							I wish to work together with you all and learn together as one so that everyone feels welcome. 
							If you have any questions or anything you want to talk to us about, feel free to reach out 
							and I'll gladly get back to you. I can't wait to see you all and work together with you!!
