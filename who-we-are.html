					<p class="intropara" id="agpara">Heyo! It's me, Agathe, your president for the 2020-2021 <br>academic year. I first joined in my sophomore year and in my <br> junior year I was elected as president. I'm the director of CAD <br> (computer-aided design), where you make 3D models of <br>anything you can quantify. Last year and this year I've <br>been on the Robotics team, where I was a member of the <br> CAD subteam. (I'm very proud of making a dual Falcon motor <br>gearbox there. Feel free to ask me about it.) This summer I <br> took a Cooper Union Drafting and Design for Engineering <br>class where I learned about how finance, business, and<br> engineering all meld together in industries. This year we're <br>aiming for an end-of-year project we can all look forward <br>to. My main goal this year is to make ModIT a club where you <br>can enjoy learning about the tech of the future! Feel free to<br> reach out to me or anyone on the board if you have <br> questions, ideas, or just want to talk! I look forward to seeing<br> y'all! :3 </p>

					<p class="intropara amp" id="ampara">Hello! I'm Amanda and I'm the vice president of the club. I'm <br>also in charge of sharing the joy of coding with you. I ended <br>up becoming interested in coding when I joined the school's<br> robotics team and learned about their software engineering <br>section. I soon fell in love with coding, and began with <br>learning Java. I hope to also inspire you to love coding as I <br>do and become interested in pursuing it later on. I wish to<br> work together with you all and learn together as one so that <br>everyone feels welcome. If you have any questions or <br>anything you want to talk to us about, feel free to reach out <br>and I'll gladly get back to you. I can't wait to see you all and <br>work together with you!!</p>
					
					<img src="soniaavatar.PNG" alt="ModIT Social Media Manager" class="avatars" id="so">
					<p class="intropara" id="sopara">Hi! I'm Sonia Hasko and I am very excited to be <br>your social media manager for the 2020-2021 <br>school year. My goal is to reach more people by<br> publicizing ModIT's work, ultimately <br>showing students that learning computer <br>science can be fun! I will prioritize access to <br>free, easy-to-use resources and hope to improve <br>communication between members and leaders. I <br>want every person in ModIT to feel like they<br>belong, so I am here for any questions and/or <br>concerns you may have!</p>
					
					<img src="angelinaavatar.PNG" alt="ModIT Secretary" class="avatars" id="an">
					<p class="intropara" id="anpara">Hello! I am Angelina, the secretary of ModIT. My <br>vision is to create an organized, productive, and <br>stress-free environment by creating a schedule <br>to keep our club on track. I am also the director <br>of code! I unintentionally stumbled upon the <br>computer science world when I took APCSA <br>(Java) in my sophomore year. It was an <br>overwhelming challenge, but it was worth it to <br>gain a new skill that I may implement in a future <br>career. Whether you are seeking to <br>gain/practice a new STEM skill, find a new <br>passion, or explore your comp sci interest <br>deeper, I hope that ModIT will be a community <br>for you to do so. If you ever feel overwhelmed <br>about your work, I'm always free to talk! <br>I am here for you <3</p>
					
					<img src="niddhiavatar.PNG" alt="ModIT Treasurer" class="avatars" id="ni">
					<p class="intropara" id="nipara">Hi! My name is Nidhi Mahadevan, and I will be <br>your treasurer for the 2020-2021 school year. I <br>am also the director of Data Analysis. This past<br> summer, I learned how to use R through an <br>internship at the Memorial Sloan Kettering <br>Cancer Center and suggested adding it to<br> ModIT. While my role as treasurer will be limited<br> because of the current learning model, I still <br>want to ensure that everyone has the best <br>experience possible, so feel free to reach out if <br>you have any questions! </p>
